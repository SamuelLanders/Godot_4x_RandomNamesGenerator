🛠️ Installation

Download the RandomTimer addon for Godot 4.x.
Extract the random_timer folder into the addons folder within your Godot project directory.
Enable the addon in Godot's plugins tab. (Project > Project Settings > Plugins)


📖 Usage
Can use as either main screen plugin (click interface) or as direct plugin to your application (call to class_name NameGenerator.new_name() )
 
Generates an array of names (strings) with current indexed entries of:
1. Female (first & last name) using real world database of names
2. Male (first & last name) using real world database of names
3. Unisex (first name) using Emi's code for random fantasy name generation
4. Unisex (first name-short) using Sam's code for random fantasy name generation
5. Unisex (first name-medium) using Sam's code for random fantasy name generation
6. Unisex (first name-long) using Sam's code for random fantasy name generation

Using multiple different methods, including a small database of a few thousand names commonly found in the world, this generator builds multiple random full names for you to quickly choose from. It generates both true real world, and realistic fantasy names. The underlying code is designed to be expandable. Please feel free to help contribute to its growth.

This is a 'Main screen plugin' and will appear next to the 2D,3D,Script,AssetLib buttons in the top center of Godot 4.x
