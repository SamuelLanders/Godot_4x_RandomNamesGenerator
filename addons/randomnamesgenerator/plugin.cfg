name="RandomNamesGenerator"
description="Generates an array of names (strings) with current indexed entries of:
1. Female (first & last name) using real world database of names
2. Male (first & last name) using real world database of names
3. Unisex (first name) using Emi's code for random fantasy name generation
4. Unisex (first name-short) using Sam's code for random fantasy name generation
5. Unisex (first name-medium) using Sam's code for random fantasy name generation
6. Unisex (first name-long) using Sam's code for random fantasy name generation

Using multiple different methods, including a small database of a few thousand names commonly found in the world, this generator builds multiple random full names for you to quickly choose from. It generates both true real world, and realistic fantasy names. The underlying code is designed to be expandable, so you can contribute to its growth.
